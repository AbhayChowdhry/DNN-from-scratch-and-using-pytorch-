# DNN-from-scratch-and-using-pytorch-

### Datasets and Dataloaders
- Created dataset and dataloaders from scratch, from downloading MNSIT dataset from wget commands to efficiently opening then in dataset classes using os commands. This helped gain a deeper understanding of how dataloders and datasets work internally.
- Compared Scratch implementations with those provided by pytorch

### Models
Created the following four models:
- NN using pytorch using ReLu activation
- NN from scratch using ReLu activation (Xavier activations)
- NN using pytorch using sigmoid activation
- NN from scratch using sigmoid activation (Xavier activations)

Used batch norm helped boost accuracy a lot.
